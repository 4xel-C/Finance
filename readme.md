# Finance Web Application

This is an example of a web application using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQLite3, and Python (Flask) to implement a website that fetches data from Yahoo's Finance API and simulates buying and selling processes.

## Functionalities 

- A user database with user connections, login, registration, password hashing, and cookies using Flask's "session" to remember logins and manage personal accounts.
- A connection to Yahoo's API, fetching stock option values in real time.
- An interface for buying and selling stocks.
- A history of all past transactions.
- A global view of all stock options owned.

You can test the server by using the command `flask run` in the root folder.
